Widget to display a countdown timer for a recurring event.

== Description ==

Displays a countdown until the event begins. Specify an event duration time and it will display a different message while the event is happening. After the event is over, the countdown will begin again.

Uses string-to-time (strtotime) formats which can be very simple or very complex.

The widget has many CSS classes to style it with, but it's been left purposely unstyled so you can format it in whatever way you want. The included recurring-timer-widget.css and recurring-timer-widget.css-example files show how you can move the time and labels around for a custom look. You can customize recurring-timer-widget.css by copying it to your active theme's folder.

Known issues:

* It requires a browser refresh before the "next next" event. i.e. If you're viewing the widget and the timer is set for a daily event, the timer will countdown to today's event, then countdown to tomorrow's event. But it will not countdown to the day after tomorrow's event unless the browser is refreshed.
* Events that occur more than once in a 24-hour period have not been tested and may not work.


== Installation ==

1. Unzip and upload the plugin to your 'wp-content/plugins' directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Add the widget to your site through the 'Widgets' menu in WordPress (under 'Appearance').
1. Optionally copy recurring-timer-widget.css-example or recurring-timer-widget.css to recurring-timer-widget.css in your active theme folder to customize the style. You may also style the widget by customizing the stylesheet in your theme.

Please note this comment on php.net: [http://us.php.net/manual/en/datetime.formats.relative.php#98989](http://us.php.net/manual/en/datetime.formats.relative.php#98989) In my screenshot example I used "fourth thursday of this month" for the Event Day. This only works in PHP 5.3+. However, removing the 'of' and using "fourth thursday this month" works in earlier versions of PHP. Your mileage may vary, so you'll want to experiment if your timer is displaying negative time and/or counting up.

== Screenshots ==

1. Widget menu in WP-Admin with an example event.
2. An un-styled version of the widget (not very pretty).
3. The widget using the example CSS file for style.
